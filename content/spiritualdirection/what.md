<h2> What is Spiritual Direction? </h2>
Spiritual direction is the practice of being with people as they learn and grow in their own personal spirituality.  This practice can focus on specific religious topics or more general divinity.  Spiritual direction can develop a deeper awareness with the spiritual aspect of being human.
