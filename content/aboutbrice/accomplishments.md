<!-- end ORGANIZATION/SUBTITLE AND DATE -->
<!-- DESCRIPTION --> 
  <div class="card-text"> 
    <p> Oak Grove Lutheran Church’s pastor Brice Eichlersmith has lived by the mantra, “show up, shut up and be present in people lives” as he has helped Richfield’s residents deal with difficult situations. He has worked to bring people together at Richfield’s schools, faith communities and in the case of the Richfield Police and Fire Chaplain program in some of the city’s most difficult times. For his contributions to the city, the city council bestowed upon him the Gene and Mary Jacobson Outstanding Citizen Award to him back in June. </p>
  <p> For the thirty-fourth episode of the That’s Rich(field) podcast we discuss what called him to become a pastor, the challenges associated with being a police and fire chaplain and what it was like to be named Richfield’s outstanding citizen.</p>
