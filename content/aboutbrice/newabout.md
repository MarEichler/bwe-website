I have truly enjoyed my career as a Pastor and my favorite part is being able to connect with people.  My experience has given me the opportunity to talk about faith and spirituality many different kinds of people.  


<h3> Calling </h3> 
In love, God became human in Jesus Christ, met us in the world we live in, and took up a cross to know and claim us fully.  Inspired by this gift, I am called to know that loving God, and to enter into Christ-centered relationships with others so that they may also come to know God and embrace Godâ€™s abundant grace.
